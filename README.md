## The entire process can be broken down into the following steps:-
1.ðŸ“‚ Loading the Excel files to PowerBI
2.ðŸ“Œ Data Cleaning and Data Transformations in Power Query
3.ðŸ“Œ Data Processing
4.ðŸ“Œ KPI Generations
5.ðŸ“Œ Create Calculated measure values and columns
6.ðŸ“· Imported Images
7.ðŸ•° Calendar Date Table in Power BI
8.âŒ› Calculated YTD and YoY Growth using DAX
